# onlineschool.
PHP &amp; MySQL project to learn and build a fully functional frontend - backend website,

This project is still in progress and not finished yet.

The goal is to have a fully functional onlineschool website for teaching English.
After Login there will be an area for the pupils where they have access to their materials and where they can upload their homework.
There will also be  an admin area for the teachers to be able, to change certain content of the website, access the homework etc.
I might add more stuff as I go along.
On the end it should be possible to have a fully functional stack where the Design is separated from the Code.

Since the project is still in progress there is still a lot to do.
