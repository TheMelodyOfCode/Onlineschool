PHP &amp; MySQL project to learn and build a fully functional frontend - backend website
This project is still in progress. The goal is to have a fully functional teaching english Onlineschool website.
After Login there will be an area for the pupils where they have acces to their materials and where they can upload their homework.
Ther will also be  an area for the teachers where they are able to change certain content of the wbsite, access the homework etc.
I might add mor stuff as I go along.
This is just a project for me to learn about php, mysql, javascript.
On the end it should be possible to have one stack where only the design needs to be changed and the website can be turned into whatever Website since the code is sepparated from the style.
