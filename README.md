# onlineschool.
PHP & MySQL project to learn and build a fully functional frontend - backend website,

This project has almost been completed. It's still missing a pay-sytem for pro and enterprise, 
an email system for registration and password reset for the user.
Apart from a few styling issues that still need to be done, the webite is fully functional.
Since it's an onlineschool we have 2 sorts of users.

Students:

After registration students get routed to their dashboard. Here they can upload, edit and view their documents (homework).
The documents are bound by userid, so students can only see their own documents.
On the student dashboard they can also update their profile, view the Gallery or get in contact with other students and their teachers.
More important the students can access the learning area they have signed up to.
The routing system takes them (depending of their status) either to the free, pro or enterprise learning area.

Teachers:

Teacher have their own Dashboard which is also an admin Dashboard.
The teacher dashboard gives them the option to check edit or delete the students documents (they are able to see all documents), 
upload photos to the gallery, change the content of the free, pro or enterprise learning area. (like a CMS system).
and update their own profile or upload their own documents.

A documentation of the functinallity will follow.

You will also find a mindmap in the src folder.
