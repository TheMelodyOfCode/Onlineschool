# onlineschool
PHP &amp; MySQL project to learn and build a fully functional frontend - backend website,

This project is still in progress! 
The goal is to have a fully functional onlineschool website for teaching English.
After Login there will be an area for the pupils where they have acces to their materials and where they can upload their homework.
Ther will also be  an admin area for the teachers to be able to change certain content of the wbsite, access the homework etc.
I might add mor stuff as I go along.
On the end it should be possible to have a fully functional stack where the Design is separated from the Code.

Since the project is still in progress there is still a lot to do.
